This is a simple Streamlit web application for generating white cat images using the "Stable-Cats-Generator" model.
The model is based on Stable Diffusion v2 and has been fine-tuned for generating white cat images from text prompts.
## Model Information
* Model Name: Stable-Cats-Generator
* Model Version: v1
* Model Type: Image Generation
* Based on: Stable Diffusion v2

## Model Description
Stable-Cats-Generator is an image generation model fine-tuned for generating white cat images based on text prompts. It is built upon Stable Diffusion v2 and utilizes a pretrained text encoder (OpenCLIP-ViT/H) for text-to-image generation.**https://huggingface.co/ayoubkirouane/Stable-Cats-Generator**

## Potential Use Cases
* Generating cat images for artistic purposes
* Investigating biases and limitations of generative models
* Creating safe and customizable content
* Enhancing educational or creative tools

## Model Capabilities
* High-quality white cat image generation
* Quick image generation, even on single GPUs
* Customizable for specific needs and datasets

## Limitations
+ May not always produce realistic images
+ Limited to generating white cat images based on text prompts
+ Ethical considerations when using generated content

## Ethical Considerations
+ Ensure generated content is safe and non-harmful
+ Monitor and mitigate potential biases in generated content
+ Respect copyright and licensing when using generated images

## Usage

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```
